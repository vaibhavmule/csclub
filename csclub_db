2	Role of Company Secretary	role-of-company-secretary	A Company Secretary (CS) is a governance professional possessing multi-disciplinary knowledge. CS is not only responsible for the compliance of various laws by the Company but also acts as an advisor to the Board of Directors on many matters. He/ she is the conscience keeper of the Company and has been recognized as a Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\nThis article explains the broad outline of the role of a CS in companies- duties, functions, and responsibilities. So, if you are opting for the CS course and choose to be employed in a Company this is how your work will be. And this is what you should prepare yourself for&#8230;\n\n<strong>Statutory Role and Core Responsibilities</strong>\n\nIn India, the CS profession has been propelled to the corporate limelight, by the significant recognition granted to it under the Companies Act, 2013. Under the Act, a CS must perform the following functions and duties:-\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Compliance Reporting:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThis could be said to be the foremost responsibility of the CS. He/ she must report to the top level i.e, the Board of Directors about the compliances and deviations made by the company under various laws, rules, regulations etc. It is the duty of the CS to keep the Board informed on issues arising from compliance or non-compliance.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Guidance to the Board:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nCS must provide guidance to the directors of the company regarding their duties, responsibilities, and powers. Moreover, holding a key position and having information on policymaking, he/ she is also expected to provide assistance in conducting the affairs of the company.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Convening and Attending Meetings:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nCompany Secretary is entrusted with convening and attending board meetings, general meetings, and committee meetings. He/she must also maintain and preserve the minutes and records of these meetings.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Obtaining approvals from the board, shareholders, government and other authorities etc:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nUsually, decisions or transactions require the approval of the board or shareholders or sometimes even the government. In such cases, it is the CS who ensures that necessary legal procedures are followed and obtains approval from the appropriate persons.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Representation before regulators, tribunals, and other authorities:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nA Company Secretary&#8217;s work is not just limited to record-keeping and administration. In the event of disputes, the CS is empowered to represent the Company in quasi-judicial forums like the Company Law Tribunal, Tax Tribunal, Securities Appellate Tribunal etc.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Ensuring corporate governance:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\n&#8220;Corporate Governance&#8221; is the buzzword these days and it is necessarily a cornerstone of corporate sustainability and goodwill. CS as a Key Managerial Personnel must ensure that his/ her company follows the best corporate governance practices.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Other duties assigned by the Board from time to time:-</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThis is an interesting aspect of the statutory role. What it really means is that apart from the functions mentioned above, any other duty that is assigned by the board to the CS is also an essential part of his mandate. This point offers immense scope and opportunity for carving a niche for the Company Secretary in the organization. Many senior professionals in the industry have crossed beyond the standard role of CS and don dynamic and versatile roles.\n\n<strong>Other Additional Responsibilities</strong>\n\nApart from the above primary duties, there are certain other responsibilities which the Company Secretary has to fulfill. They are:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>Authentication of documents and contracts</li>\n \t<li>Signing financial statements of the company</li>\n \t<li>Signing of share certificates of the company</li>\n \t<li>Signing annual return</li>\n \t<li>Acting as Compliance Officer in the case of a listed entity. The CS will be responsible for overseeing share transfers, shareholder grievance redressal and liaising with the SEBI and other stock market intermediaries</li>\n \t<li>Liaising with various stakeholders- trade unions, workers, shareholders, community etc</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Liability of Company Secretary</strong>\n\n&#8220;With great power comes great responsibility&#8221;. Holding true to these words, a Company Secretary is also equally liable for default. Company Secretary is included in the list of &#8220;officers in default&#8221; and can be held responsible for non-compliance under various provisions of the law.\n\nThus, the position of Company Secretary is one of great power and pride. However, one must be extremely committed, meticulous, and knowledgeable and also possess a high level of integrity to occupy this position.\n\nHope this write-up would have given you a brief insight into the role of CS in companies. In forthcoming articles, we shall look into the various domains in which a CS is present an alternative career prospects.

3	How to Find Vacancies for CS Training	find-vacancies-cs-training	<strong>Focus</strong>\n\nOne of the most important aspects of completing the Company Secretaryship (CS) course is the long-term practical training. Passing the exams is only half the job. CS training- Where you do it? A firm or a company or some other institution? What did you learn during the period? - is the other half. This, in some ways, determines the initial few years of your CS career.\n\nThis post gives a brief overview of the training structure. It also details the steps to find vacancies for CS training.\n\n<strong>Training Structure</strong>\n\nCurrently, there are two formats of training:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>15-months structure for students who registered for the CS Executive Program before 31<sup>st</sup> March 2014 (called &#8220;Earlier Training Structure&#8221;)</li>\n \t<li>1/2/3 year structure for those who registered for the CS Executive Program on or after 1<sup>st</sup> April 2014 (called &#8220;Modified Training Structure&#8221;) as per the level of program</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Note: </strong>Students who registered before 31<sup>st</sup> March 2014 can also opt for the &#8220;Modified Training Structure&#8221; by a switch-over request. Visit <a href="https://www.icsi.edu/Portals/8/PROCEDURE%20FOR%20OPTING%20FOR%20THE%20MODIFIED%20TRAINING.pdf">Procedure for opting out for modified training structure.</a>\n\nApart from the long-term training, there are other short-term training programs to be completed alongside. A comparative table below contains information on the various kinds of training:-\n<table width="631">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="160"><strong>Components of Training</strong></td>\n<td width="146"><strong>Duration of</strong>\n\n<strong>training</strong></td>\n<td width="162"><strong>Earlier Training</strong>\n\n<strong>Structure</strong></td>\n<td width="163"><strong>Modified Training</strong>\n\n<strong>Structure</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="160"><strong>Executive Development</strong>\n\n<strong>Programme(EDP)</strong></td>\n<td width="146">8 days\n\n(After passing\n\nExecutive\n\nProgramme)</td>\n<td width="162">Applicable</td>\n<td width="163">Not Applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="160"><strong>Long Terms Internship</strong>\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td width="146">-</td>\n<td width="162">15 months\n\n(After passing\n\nExecutive Programme)</td>\n<td width="163">3 years on\n\nregistration to Executive\n\nProgramme;\n\n<strong>or</strong>\n\n2 years after passing\n\nthe Executive\n\nProgramme;\n\n<strong>or</strong>\n\n1 year after passing\n\nthe Professional\n\nProgramme</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="160">Professional\n\nDevelopment\n\nProgramme ( PDP)</td>\n<td width="146">24 hours</td>\n<td width="162">Applicable</td>\n<td width="163">Not Applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="160">Training with\n\nspecialized agency</td>\n<td width="146">15 days</td>\n<td width="162">Applicable</td>\n<td width="163">Not Applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="160">Management Skills\n\nOrientation Programme\n\n( MSOP)</td>\n<td width="146">15 days</td>\n<td width="162">Applicable</td>\n<td width="163">Applicable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nSource: ICSI Training Guide\n\nThe ICSI has also recently introduced a 15-days academic program applicable students clearing CS Executive Program on or after 25<sup>th</sup> August 2015. Visit for details of&#160;<a href="http://www.icsi.edu/Portals/11/15_days_academic_program_as_on_1-02-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 days academic program as on 1-02-2016</a>\n\n<strong>How to find vacancies for long-term CS training?</strong>\n\nNow that we have seen in detail the kinds of training, let us move to the important question- How to find vacancies? This surely is a question that bothers many CS aspirants. While some may take it seriously and some others see it as just another step in the course, the undeniable fact is that- it matters!\n\nPractical training is a crucial aspect of not only putting to test theoretical knowledge but also charting the course of your CS career. What you learn in this period, both technical and non-technical should be utilized effectively.\n\nThe major sources to find information about trainee vacancies are:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>The ICSI website</li>\n \t<li>ICSI regional offices and chapters</li>\n \t<li>Job-finding platforms like Naukri, Shine etc (but very few openings are advertised in these platforms)</li>\n \t<li>Social media like WhatsApp, Facebook- one can be part of CS communities where such information is posted (again this also ranks lower compared to the first two)</li>\n</ul>\nI shall be detailing here on the first two sources alone for obvious reasons.\n\n<strong><em>ICSI website:-</em></strong>\n\nThe ICSI website has a dedicated page for trainee/ job vacancies. An excel sheet containing info on openings is hosted and updated regularly.\n<ol>\n \t<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.icsi.edu">ICSI website</a>.</li>\n \t<li>On the homepage under the head &#8220;Activities &amp; Initiatives&#8221; you will find the tab &#8220;Training opportunities for students&#8221;</li>\n \t<li>Click on the above tab; you will be redirected to another page containing the link &#8220;vacancies for CS trainees&#8221;</li>\n \t<li>An excel sheet containing information on vacancies will be downloaded; most recent openings will appear first</li>\n</ol>\nFor ease of access, I am giving the link here: <a href="https://www.icsi.edu/TrainingOpportunities.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traning Opportunity</a>\n\n<strong><em>There is another much easier way</em></strong>! <strong>You could check out our discourse community- <a href="https://forum.csclub.co/c/jobs/cs-trainee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company Secretary Trainee Vacancies</a>. The information given by ICSI in the excel sheet is updated here simultaneously. You just have to visit the page sans the trouble of downloading and checking each detail. CSClub has all information readily, neatly available. </strong>\n\n<strong>Try it and let us know what you think!</strong>\n\n<strong><em>ICSI Regional Offices and Chapters </em></strong>\n\nThis is another reliable information source. You could try the following means:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>Mail your request to the chapter in the city where you intend to do your training. Ex; If you want to do your training in Pune, mail the Pune Chapter of ICSI to update you regarding trainee vacancies. Most chapters have this facility.</li>\n \t<li>Physically visit the Chapter and check Notice Board to get updates. This is quite tiresome as not everybody has the time to visit personally.</li>\n \t<li>Visit the ICSI webpage of Regional Offices or send in a mail request to them. You could also check out their Notice Board physically.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="https://forum.csclub.co/t/recommended-template-of-resume-for-cs-trainees-articleship-in-pdf-and-word/1198?u=vaibhavmule">Recommended Template of <strong>Resume</strong> for CS Trainees Articleship in PDF and Word</a>\n\nHope this article was useful in giving you some inputs. In the next post, I shall discuss few tips on finding the right kind of organization for your training and do/don&#8217;ts during your training.\n\nIt would be great to have your feedback!

5	Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017	companies-amendment-bill-2017	The Companies Act, 2013 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) is set to be amended for the second time in almost four years since it was first enforced in September 2013. The first amendment Act was passed in 2015.\n\nThis year the Lok Sabha passed the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 (&#8220;the Bill&#8221;) on 27<sup>th</sup> July 2017. The Rajya Sabha cleared the Bill on 19<sup>th</sup> December 2017. It proposes about hundred odd amendments to the Act and now awaits the President&#8217;s assent. The changes are expected to come into effect next year.\n\nThis article gives a brief overview of the objects and highlights of the Bill.\n\n<strong>Why the need for a Second Amendment?</strong>\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013 in its current form has been criticized for various reasons; lacuna in drafting, stringent requirements for small companies and procedural hassles being the most predominant ones.\n\nThe Bill seeks to address these issues of interpretation, drafting, stringent compliance requirements and cumbersome procedures. Broadly, the objectives of the Bill are:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>Improving ease of doing business</li>\n \t<li>Strengthening corporate governance standards</li>\n \t<li>Strict penalty on defaulting companies</li>\n \t<li>Changes addressing errors and omissions</li>\n \t<li>Bringing provisions of the Act in line with other statutory regulations viz., SEBI regulations, RBI regulations and Accounting Standards</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Highlights of the Bill</strong>\n\nThe Bill contains more than hundred amendments. It impacts major provisions relating to raising capital through private placement, issuing shares at discount, penalty for default etc.\n\nBelow are some important highlights of the Bill:-\n\n<strong><em>1. Alteration in definitions</em></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>Associate Company</em>- significant influence will mean &#8216;control of at least 20% of <strong>voting power </strong>or control or participation in business decisions under an agreement&#8217;. Presently, it is &#8216;20% of share capital&#8217; or control under agreement.</li>\n \t<li><em>Financial Year</em>- associate company can also apply to the NCLT for adopting a different financial year. Currently, only Indian holding or subsidiary companies of a foreign company can apply.</li>\n \t<li><em>Holding Company</em>- Body corporate to be considered as &#8216;holding company&#8217;. This will affect the corporate structure and compliance requirements.</li>\n \t<li><em>Key Managerial Personnel</em>- whole-time employees one level below the Board to be included in the definition</li>\n \t<li><em>Related Party</em>- &#8216;any company&#8217; is replaced by &#8216;any Body Corporate&#8217;. Investing companies and entities have also been included.</li>\n \t<li><em>Turnover-</em> to mean gross revenue recognized in profit and loss account.</li>\n \t<li>Clarification in the definition of cost accountant, interested director, net worth, public company, subsidiary company etc</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>2.&#160;<em>Reservation of Name during Incorporation</em></strong>\n\nName reserved shall be valid for 20 days from approval. Currently, it is 20 days from &#8216;<em>application&#8217;.</em>\n\n<strong><em>3. Time limit for having registered office increased from the present 15 days to 30 days of incorporation.</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>4. Authentication of documents, proceedings and contracts can be done by an employee of the company. Currently, only KMP or officer of the Company is authorized.</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>5. Relief for directors from civil liability for misstatement in prospectus. This is subject to certain conditions.</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>6. Substitution of entire section on private placement of shares</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>7. Number of changes in provisions on Financial Statement and Board&#8217;s Report. Noteworthy among them is that, now the CEO must also sign the financials and Board&#8217;s Report whether or not he is a director.</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>8. Loans to Directors</em></strong>\n\nThe entire section is to be replaced with some allowances and restrictions as compared to existing provisions\n\n<strong><em>9. Related Party Transactions </em></strong>\n\nRestriction on voting by relatives in case of closely-held family companies has been lifted. If 90% members (in number) are relatives of promoters or related parties, then the restriction on voting will not apply.\n\n<strong><em>10. &#8216;Pecuniary interest&#8217; of Independent Directors to be replaced with &#8216;pecuniary relationship&#8217; </em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>11. Managerial Remuneration</em></strong>\n\nCentral Government approval for payment of managerial remuneration in excess of prescribed limits has been removed. Now, it is sufficient to pass a special resolution. However, in case of default in payment of dues, approval of bank/ non-convertible debenture holder/ secured creditor will be required before passing special resolution.\n\n<strong><em>12. Fee payable for late filing</em></strong>\n\nThe existing structure of late fee payable for e-forms is set to be revamped. Staggered timelines for delay will go. Late fee will be calculated on daily basis just like for LLPs.\n\nThe full text of the Bill is given here <a href="http://csclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CompaniesAmendmentBill2017_LokSabha.pdf">Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017</a>\n\n<em>Disclaimer: This article is only for educational/ awareness purpose.

6	Study Tips for Company Secretaryship (CS) Exams	study-tips-company-secretaryship-cs-exams	&#8216;Exams&#8217; is the most dreaded word for a CS student or for that matter any person who does a professional course. Writing this post brings back memories. I too have passed through this stage and &#8216;googled&#8217; this topic many a times..!\n\nThere is so much one can write on this. But, I shall try to be as direct, simple and brief as I can (while also giving <strong><em>all </em></strong>the answers to your queries and worries!)\n\nMy tax teacher once told us that studying for a professional course involves three stages. First is learning and understanding. Second is revision. Third and final being exam preparation. Those words made me reflect a lot. In fact, it eased the difficulty of passing CS.\n\nSo, here I share with you some useful study tips for clearing your CS exams. I shall first list down some general tips for the whole course. Thereafter, I will discuss the approach for CS Foundation, CS Executive and CS Professional. In the end, we finish with&#8230; Well we wish you all the very best!\n\n<em>(Note: I am sorry that this post is a little delayed. I know CS exams have already begun. But, I assure you- what you read will stand the test of time. You could use it for other courses. You could also tell your friends who are going to appear in future.)</em>\n\n<span style="color: #003366"><strong>General Tips- Let&#8217;s Sort this Out</strong></span>\n\nPreparing for the CS course should be seen in totality. Exams are an important means to an end (becoming a Company Secretary). The problem arises when you start blurring out everything else other than the CS exams. So, here are few things to look out for.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Understanding the Course Contents &amp; Syllabus</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Firstly, go through the whole syllabus. Try to understand the demands for each paper. What is the level of knowledge required? Can you study on your own or will you require coaching?</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>2. Decide on the Number of Groups </strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">The next step is to analyze your goals, time and self (like a SWOT analysis). Understand the time you will be able to devote for each subject. Whether you can study a lot in a small time frame? Or would you like to take small but sure steps? Based on this, decide the number of groups you would write. You <strong><em>must </em></strong>decide this in the <strong><em>beginning itself</em></strong>. Most students dilly-dally their way to the exams without understanding these things. This results in a lot of anxiety and stress.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>3. The Study Plan</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Now, you have set a clear goal after due diligence. You will be more confident towards approaching and achieving it. Proceed to prepare a study plan for each subject. It should take into account the following:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Time frame for initial learning and covering of the syllabus</li>\n \t<li>Setting <strong>realistic goals </strong>leading to syllabus completion</li>\n \t<li>Setting a revision timetable. But, I would like to point out here that revision is not exclusive of learning. Both should go together for maximum retention <em>(Read on to find out).</em></li>\n \t<li>Final component of the plan should be exam preparation. You should try to answer maximum number of question papers. Evaluate and score your answers. Improve presentation and speed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">For Example; If you have 10 months for your preparation, you should ideally use first 7 months for learning, next 2 months for revisions (at least twice) and then the final 1 month for exam preparation.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>4. Stick to the Plan</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Once you have neatly laid out a study plan, it doesn&#8217;t end there. You must sincerely stick to it. Of course, we are humans and there may be lapses. But, if at any point you feel you are not able to keep up make suitable changes to the plan.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>5. Few Words of Wisdom</strong></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">The above four points are undoubtedly the most important ones. However, I would like to share a few equally significant points that most people miss out on.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Study because you <strong>need to understand the subjects and their application in your future. </strong></li>\n \t<li>You must have <strong>thorough knowledge</strong> of the subject. CS is a professional course. Skimming through scanners will not help you. Shun the advice of those who say that they made it only with a month of preparation. What you study is not only for exams, it is for your future.</li>\n \t<li>You must <strong>regularly revise</strong> what you study. For example; you finish studying the first chapter &#8216;Incorporation of a Company&#8217; within a week. Then you proceed to other chapters 2, 3, 4 etc. in the subsequent three weeks. Now, what you studied in the first week would have vanished unless you had revised it. So, recall whatever you study, periodically. Don&#8217;t make it a race to tick-off chapters.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Scanners&#8230; </strong>They are excellent supplements to devise your study plan. However, do not just learn the answers from the scanner. Learn a topic and then try to relate questions from the scanner to that specific topic. This will serve as a revision while also improving your presentation skills.</li>\n \t<li>Set <strong>realistic short-term goals </strong>to achieve your ultimate aim. You should set achievable targets depending on your ability. Setting unrealistic goals will lead to desperation and frustration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Many of my juniors have approached me with this problem. How much you can study in an hour, day, week or even months can only be judged by you<strong>. </strong>If you are good at handling big volume within a short time, then plan accordingly. Or if you study for a long-time but in detail, then you probably will need more time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Have <strong>good subject combinations</strong>. Normally, learning two subjects per day is reasonable. Mix up theory and numerical papers to avoid boredom.</li>\n \t<li>Have a <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong>. Do not make CS 24*7. It is important to have personal time. Set aside time for hobbies and interests. This will help you re-energize and better your performance.</li>\n \t<li>Go through the monthly &#8216;Student Company Secretary&#8217;, foundation and executive bulletins etc (check <a href="http://www.icsi.edu/JournalsBulletins.aspx">ICSI Journals &amp; Bulletins</a>). This will help you stay updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="color: #003366"><strong>How to Approach each Level of the Course?</strong></span>\n\n<strong>CS Foundation</strong>\n\nThe study tips I discussed are applicable to all stages of the CS course. But, there are slight differences in approach for each stage.\n\nIf you are writing CS Foundation, obviously, 10 month period is long as it has only four papers. Moreover, many of you may have studied these subjects in your school itself. But, this is your first stage in CS where you learn all the fundamentals. So, enjoy the learning process and study sincerely. Spread out the syllabus over a timeline that will suit you.\n\n<span style="color: #800080">A good score in the foundation level will boost your confidence as you move to the next level.</span>\n\n<strong>CS Executive</strong>\n\nThis is when the real deal begins. CS Executive contains the basics of all core subjects. Most of the faculty who taught me stressed this importance often enough. <span style="color: #800080">Simply put, consider CS Executive as the alphabet and CS Professional as writing an essay.</span> You can&#8217;t do the latter without knowing the former.\n\n<span style="color: #800080">The maximum effort you put into this stage, the easier the next stage becomes. So, study the concepts thoroughly.</span>\n\n<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>CS Professional</strong>\n\nThis is considered the toughest of all three, quite understandably.<span style="color: #800080"> You are expected to possess sound subject knowledge and interpretation skills.</span> In CS Executive you learnt all the laws. In CS Professional you learn it deeper along with ability to apply and criticize them. Hence, you must be absolutely well-prepared.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that studying for CS exams is not a herculean task. Rather, it becomes easy if you understand the demands of the course, make a good plan and execute it well.\n\nThat&#8217;s all folks!\n\nHope you found this article useful. Leave a comment. Let me know what you think!\n\nWishing you all the very best for an amazing and rewarding CS journey!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;	2017-12-27 12:04:08+00	2	2018-08-15 07:33:30.70289+00	2018-08-15 07:33:30.702934+00
7	Company Secretary Course Detail - A Ultimate Guide to Become a CS	company-secretary	A Company Secretary (CS) is one of the most sought-after professionals these days. Company Secretaries are present in many domains. The scope of CS Profession is not only restricted to corporate secretarial matters but has also expanded to advocacy (NCLT), corporate restructuring, insolvency resolution, liquidation, valuation, GST practice etc.\n\nThis article elaborates on the Company Secretary profession- enrolment, stages of examination, course details, syllabus and most importantly &#8220;what it takes&#8221; to be a Company Secretary.\n<h2>Who is a Company Secretary?</h2>\nA Company Secretary is a multi-disciplinary professional rendering service in:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>Corporate Governance and Secretarial Matters- advisory, arbitration, representation etc.</li>\n \t<li>Financial Markets viz. public issue, mergers, acquisitions, takeovers</li>\n \t<li>A Company Secretary in employment is:-\n<ul>\n \t<li>an in-house legal expert</li>\n \t<li>compliance officer of the Company</li>\n \t<li>An expert in corporate laws, securities laws, capital market and corporate governance</li>\n \t<li>Chief advisor to the board of directors on best practices in corporate governance</li>\n \t<li>Responsible for all regulatory compliances of the company</li>\n \t<li>Corporate planner and strategic manager</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAlthough the role of a Company Secretary as a Compliance Officer is predominant, the scope has expanded greatly in the recent past. A Company Secretary can represent before quasi-judicial (similar to courts) forums such as the Company Law Tribunal, Tax Tribunal etc. He/she can also act as an Insolvency Professional playing a key role in reviving debt-ridden companies.\n\nTherefore, today a Company Secretary is a professional working in multifarious areas possessing extensive inter-disciplinary knowledge.\n<h2>About the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI)</h2>\nThe Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) regulates and develops the CS Profession in India. It is a statutory body (i.e., set up the Company Secretaries Act, 1980 enacted by the Parliament). &#160;ICSI functions under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.\n\nICSI is headquartered in New Delhi and has four Regional Offices in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai. It also has 69 chapters across the country.\n<h2>Stages to become a Company Secretary</h2>\nNow, that you know about the role of a Company Secretary, let us see the stages you need to pass through to become one.\n\nIf you wish to pursue CS soon <strong><em>after your schooling</em></strong> (i.e. 12<sup>th</sup> Standard), you have to clear the following levels of examination.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Foundation Program</strong>- consisting of 4 papers (for the detailed syllabus, click here)</li>\n \t<li><strong>Executive Program</strong>- consisting of 7 papers split into two groups of 4 papers and 3 papers each</li>\n \t<li><strong>Professional Program</strong>- It can be pursued only after clearing the executive program. It consists of 9 papers divided into 3 groups containing 3 papers each</li>\n</ul>\nFor detailed syllabus of Executive and Professional Program visit&#160;<a href="https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/Student/SYLLEBUS2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS Executive and Professional Syllabus 2012</a>\n\n<em>Note: The syllabus is proposed to change again in 2018</em>\n\nHowever, if you wish to pursue <strong><em>CS after graduation</em></strong> then you can directly appear for the Executive Program. It means you will have to pass the Executive Program and Professional Program. Anyone who has graduated in any stream except fine arts can pursue the Executive Program.\n\nCS Exams are conducted two times a year in June and December. Information on registration for each level and enrollment for exams is given below.\n<h2>Training Requirements for Company Secretary</h2>\nPassing the three levels of examinations is only a part of the course. Apart from clearing the exams, you should also complete a set of mandatory training requirements.\n\nThe ICSI mandates long-term practical training and few other short-term training to become eligible for membership. Accordingly, a student registered for the course can undergo long-term training with a Company/ Practicing Company Secretary/ Ministry of Corporate Affairs/ Banks/ law firms.\n\nRead my post on <a href="http://csclub.co/blog/find-vacancies-cs-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Find Vacancies for CS Training</a> to know more about finding trainee vacancies.\n<h3><strong>Long-term Training (w.e.f 1<sup>st</sup> April 2014)</strong></h3>\n<strong>Three- year Training- </strong>students who have <strong>registered for the executive program</strong> are eligible to undergo three- year training\n\n<strong>Two-year Training- </strong>Students who have <strong>passed the executive program</strong> are eligible for two-year training\n\n<strong>One-year Training- </strong>Students who have <strong>passed the professional program</strong> are eligible for one- year training\n\nTo know about the kind of entities eligible to impart long-term training, visit <a href="https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/Limit_of_max_numof_trainees_to_be_taken_attime_by_various_agencies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entities eligible to Impart CS training</a>\n\n<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>The old training structure of 15 months still continues for those students who had registered on or before 31<sup>st</sup> March 2014.

This training is organized in the Regional Councils of the ICSI. Few Chapters also conduct MSOP.

The exam fee for each stage is as follows:\n\n<strong>Foundation Programme- </strong>Rs. 1200\n\n<strong>Executive Programme- </strong>Rs. 1200 per module\n\n<strong>Professional Programme-</strong> Rs. 1200 per module\n\nThe last date for enrolment in exams is 25<sup>th</sup> March (with late fee of Rs. 250/- till 9th April) for December session. For June session it is 25th September (with late fee of Rs. 250/- until 10th October).<strong>&#160;</strong>\n<h3><strong>How much time does it take to complete Company Secretary?</strong></h3>\nIf a student clears all stages of examination in the first attempt, then typically it takes about 3 to 4 years. It is important to note that in professional courses like these, the time taken purely depends on your preparation and hard work. Another factor is whether you plan to write group-by-group or all papers at one go.\n\nClearing exams on the first attempt have its own advantages. It boosts your confidence. You save precious time. It also helps you to take up parallel courses.\n<h2><strong>EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES for Company Secretary\n</strong></h2>\n<strong>&#160;</strong>Broadly, career prospects for CS involve two choices- whole-time employment or practice.&#160; Just like any other professional, a CS can choose to be employed or take up whole-time practice. But, you cannot do both at the same time, i.e., you should either opt for employment <strong>or</strong> practice.\n<h3><strong>Company Secretary as KMP</strong></h3>\nThe Companies Act, 2013 recognizes Company Secretary as a Key Managerial Personnel along with Managing Director (MD), CEO, CFO, Manager, and Whole-time director. This is important because such categorization also holds the CS responsible for defaults.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Every listed company; and</li>\n \t<li>Every other public company having a paid-up share capital of Rs. 10 crores or more</li>\n</ul>\nhas to appoint a whole time Key Managerial Personnel.\n\nThe appointment of whole time KMP is made by a Board Resolution. The appointment and removal/ resignation of a KMP must be notified to the Registrar of Companies. This implies the significant role of CS.\n<h3><strong>Company Secretary in Practice</strong></h3>\nYou can also go for practice, after obtaining the &#8216;Certificate of Practice&#8217; from the ICSI. A Practicing Company Secretary (PCS) renders services in the following areas:-\n<ol>\n \t<li>Legal, Secretarial and Corporate Governance</li>\n \t<li>Corporate Restructuring like mergers, takeovers etc.</li>\n \t<li>Arbitration and Conciliation</li>\n \t<li>Financial Management</li>\n \t<li>Project Planning</li>\n \t<li>Capital Market and Investor Relations</li>\n \t<li>Due Diligence</li>\n \t<li>Corporate Advisory Services</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>REMUNERATION OF COMPANY SECRETARY</strong></h2>\nCS is a highly responsible and remunerative profession. The salary for a CS fresher ranges between Rs. 2.5 lakhs to Rs. 6 lakhs. However, I will include a word of caution here. The pay package depends on the competence of the candidate and the kind of employer. Moreover, good companies look for the excellent academic record. It is useful to keep all this in mind when you set-off on this course.\n\nWith experience, the remuneration graph rises. Some of the experienced professionals in top companies earn anywhere between Rs. 50 lakhs to Rs. 3 crores.\n\nComparatively, the practice side may be more remunerative. But, this again depends on your knowledge, caliber, and networking.\n<h3><strong>WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A Company Secretary?</strong></h3>\nAs you may have understood by now, a Company Secretary holds immense responsibility, power, and stature. It is also a very rewarding career. Before you take your first step towards this challenging journey, there are certain aspects you should consider.\n<ul>\n \t<li>A CS is an expert in corporate and allied laws. This requires sound knowledge. You must constantly update yourself with the latest developments. It essentially means your learning does not stop with getting the title &#8216;Company Secretary&#8217;. It is an everyday job!</li>\n \t<li>CS is a professional course and needs a lot of perseverance, hard work, and mental strength. To become one you should possess all these qualities.</li>\n \t<li>Be prepared for testing times. Exams are crucial and pass percentage is in single digits. Only the fittest survive. But with clear goals, commitment, and mental strength you can indeed emerge successfully.</li>\n \t<li>Introspect yourself. You need the following minimum skills and traits:-</li>\n \t<li>Communication skills</li>\n \t<li>Positive attitude</li>\n \t<li>Academically inclination i.e. you are not the kind of person who is bored by books. If you are then this is not your area.</li>\n \t<li>Time management. Each stage of the course has about 9 months and involves vast areas of study. You should know to plan and manage your time.</li>\n</ul>\nSee my post on&#160;<a href="http://csclub.co/blog/study-tips-company-secretaryship-cs-exams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Study Tips for CS Exams</a> to get a clear idea.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stress Management.

8	Career Pursuits after Company Secretaryship (CS)	career-pursuits-company-secretaryship-cs	What are the career prospects after Company Secretaryship? This question is an important factor before deciding on the course. You clear the exams, complete your training and become a Company Secretary. What about the job afterward?\n\nIn my previous post on&#160;<a href="http://csclub.co/blog/become-company-secretary/">How to become a Company Secretary?</a> I had briefly discussed this. Like I said, there are two major choices- Practice or Employment. So going forward, we will see some worthwhile options in both these areas.\n\n<strong>Company Secretary in Practice (PCS)</strong>\n\nA PCS, as they are generally called, performs various assignments like Secretarial Audit, Due Diligence, and Corporate Restructuring etc. Recently added to this list are representations before NCLT, Insolvency Resolution, GST Practice, and valuation. Let&#8217;s have a brief look at the areas where a PCS can specialize.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Corporate Secretarial Matters</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Small companies, with paid-up capital less than Rs. 5 crore, are not required to appoint a CS. So, they outsource compliance and secretarial functions to a Practicing Company Secretary. This is also called &#8216;retainer work&#8217; in normal parlance.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Additionally, annual filing of financials and returns under Companies Act are also done by PCS. Annual Returns of companies whose paid-up capital or turnover exceed Rs. 10 crore or Rs. 50 crore respectively, have to be certified by a PCS.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Certifications &amp; Audit under SEBI, FEMA laws etc.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">PCS is recognized to conduct few periodical audits under SEBI Depositories&#8217; regulations, Listing regulations etc. They are also authorized to certify documents under FEMA laws relating to FDI, ODI etc.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Representation before NCLT</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Company Secretaries are authorized to represent before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). This offers plenty of scope as corporate disputes are commonplace in our country. Cases of oppression, mismanagement and board discord often come before the NCLT. A Company Secretary is also eligible to become a Technical Member in the NCLT.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Insolvency Practice</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was enforced in 2016. Company Secretaries are eligible to act as Insolvency Resolution Professionals (IRP) under the IBC. Corporate Insolvency is a serious issue these days and this area offers a lot of scope.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Secretarial Audit</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">The Companies Act, 2013 has made Secretarial Audit compulsory for all listed companies and also public companies having paid-up capital exceeding Rs. 50 crore or turnover exceeding Rs. 250 crores. Only a PCS has been authorized to conduct this audit.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>GST Practitioners</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Company Secretaries have been authorized to perform assessment and filing of returns under the GST laws. They have also been recognized to act as Authorised Representative before adjudicating authorities.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Corporate Restructuring</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">PCS regularly take up corporate restructuring assignments of small companies. They also provide due diligence services in big mergers, takeovers etc.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Other areas</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">Company Secretaries are also recognized to offer services under trademark laws, export-import laws, due diligence in major transactions etc.</p>\nA plethora of opportunities await Company Secretaries who have entrepreneurial instinct. Noteworthy is also the fact that many of the above areas are still nascent. Hence, young CS need to keep their eyes open and strike the iron while it&#8217;s still hot!\n\n<strong>Company Secretary in Employment</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>CS as a KMP</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">The major area in employment for CS is as a KMP in companies. Listed companies, and public companies with above Rs. 10 crore paid-up capital should have a whole-time CS. Other companies with more than Rs. 5 crore aid-up capital should also appoint CS. But, to reach the level of KMP a minimum of at least one year experience is demanded. Freshers are generally hired for the role of Secretarial Executive or at Manager Level. In listed companies, even these positions require experience. So, it is important to gather maximum information on these fronts before you look for a job.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Other Areas where CS is Employed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n \t<li>CS qualification is essential for recruitment to <strong>Grade I to IV of the Accounts Branch of Indian Company Law Service</strong>.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Law firms</strong> also regularly recruit CS for their corporate functions. This is a great opportunity for those who want to set up Practice later.</li>\n \t<li>Many <strong>PCS firms</strong> also employ Company Secretaries. However, the remuneration offered by a CS firm is generally low.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Public Sector Banks</strong>- They hire CS in non-CS functions in various grades. Recruitment is generally through written test and interview.</li>\n \t<li>Regulatory authorities like <strong>SEBI and RBI</strong>. These bodies are the supreme authorities for corporate regulations in our country and recruit Company Secretaries for various roles. You must keep a check on their employment notifications.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stock Exchanges</strong>- they are required to comply with a large number of regulations. Hence, they do employ a sizeable number of Company Secretaries.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Big Audit Firms</strong>- they usually have separate verticals for corporate secretarial services. But, they generally look for candidates with excellent academic record and sound domain knowledge.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Indian Corporate Law Services (ICLS) -</strong> You could appear for the UPSC exams after CS and pursue a career in ICLS. It brings honour and satisfaction.</li>\n</ol>\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that the career opportunities for a Company Secretary are aplenty. However, it is wise to be aware of the many avenues before entering the course. This will help you make the right career moves and become successful.\n\nHope this article threw some light on career prospects of CS&#8230; Do leave your comments and queries.\n\nWishing you all the very best for a bright career!	2017-12-31 16:49:55+00	2	2018-08-15 07:33:30.712273+00	2018-08-15 07:33:30.712296+00

4	5 Things you need to know about CS Training	5-things-need-know-cs-training	<p>In my <a href="https://csclub.co/blogs/find-vacancies-cs-training/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I had discussed finding vacancies for CS training. I had also mentioned that I would be sharing a few tips to keep in mind while undergoing your training. So, here are a few crucial things you should know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Where to do your training?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where you undergo your training is highly important. It determines the kind of exposure and learning you will get. Broadly the choice is between a firm and a company. A big or mid-size firm gives the opportunity to work in different domains like secretarial audit, insolvency, NCLT etc. apart from normal secretarial work. But, a small firm is unlikely to give wide exposure. A good way to find out whether a particular firm is suitable for you is to inquire. Ask employees or trainees you know about the kind of work the firm specializes in, their clients, work culture etc. On the other hand, a Company gives you an idea of how actually a Secretarial Department functions. It gives the merit of working in a corporate atmosphere. If shown enough competence, some companies also offer employment. However, the scope of learning is comparatively restricted in a Company as the focus is only on the functions of one company (unless it is a big company with many subsidiaries). Moreover, a trainee is not delegated core tasks and hence work may become repetitive. In both cases, career goals, ability to withstand pressure and thirst for knowledge play a key role in deciding the fruitfulness of your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Stipend- Does it matter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, companies pay better stipends than firms. There is a statutory minimum amount of stipend payable by trainers (visit <a href="https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/Stipend_payable_students_during_trainingperiod.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stipend payable during training period</a>). Whether the amount of stipend matters is a purely personal choice. But, it is wise to strike a balance between learning opportunity and money. The primary goal of your training should be to learn as much as you can. <strong>3) Taking up training before or after exams</strong> The current training structure offers the choice to take up training before or after completion of exams. (To know more about CS Training Structure, read&nbsp;<a href="https://csclub.co/blogs/find-vacancies-cs-training/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to Find Vacancies for CS Training</a>) This again is a personal decision. One benefit of giving exams while doing your training is that you will be able to comprehend the subjects better. This is because of hands-on practical knowledge. However, the reverse is also true that a minimum basic understanding of theory helps you to work. Ask yourself the following questions before deciding:-</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Whether the work load would allow time to study and give exams?</li>\r\n\t<li>What is the leave policy of your trainer? Although the ICSI allows a minimum number of leaves (check this <a href="https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/Guidelines%20for%20calculating%20leaves%20during%20training%20and%20submitting%20Training%20Completion%20Certificate.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ICSI&#39;s Guidelines for calculating leaves during training</a>), it is the prerogative of the trainer to grant leave. Hence, it is better to have clarity on this.</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you good at handling the pressure? Can you work from 9 am to 6 pm and then make time to study?</li>\r\n\t<li>How many groups do you plan to write? Whether you plan to write altogether or one by one? This again depends on the above two questions. It is wiser to write each group separately as it is less demanding and lets you pace the course over your training period.</li>\r\n\t<li>What are your priorities? Exams or training? While exams are the most clinching factor on your path to qualifying the profession, the train is more of a procedural step. It is important to think along these lines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Handling Work Pressure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where most people find it difficult. Points 2 and 3 are highly relevant here. Majority of the students see training as another box to tick-off on their way to becoming a Company Secretary. This is an unhealthy attitude. Working in a formal atmosphere and taking up assignments are part of your profession. Although you may be a trainee, you should carry the attitude of an employee and take ownership of what you do. Having the right attitude towards work and personal discipline is half the job in handling pressure. Remember these points:-</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Your goal is to learn as much as you can within a short span of time.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Show enthusiasm and curiosity in every task given no matter how unimportant it may seem to you.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be polite and humble but also equally assertive (not aggressive) with your colleagues and seniors.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respect the job you do.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Manage your time efficiently. This is the single most important thing on which everyone misses out. Be a master of your time and not the other way round.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Take notes and keep a record of whatever you do. This helped me a lot during my training. It helps you understand the learning curve. It is also useful in reporting and assessing your achievements.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Set task-oriented goals. When given an assignment, break it up and set timelines for each step. This will enable you to attain the ultimate objective with ease.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Do not hesitate to ask. You are there to learn. Ask, clarify and debate wherever you have doubts.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Last but not the least; do not be intimidated by any situation. Whatever be the circumstance, approach with a calm and balanced mind.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) Submission of Training Records</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registering your training commencement records with the Institute should be done within 60 days. There is a penalty for delay in registration of training (<a href="https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/Latefine.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fine Payable by Students for Late Submission of Records beyond 60 days</a>). This may not seem important. But, submission of your training contract, quarterly reports and project report on time ensures that there are no hassles when applying for membership. Always be prompt. I have discussed here a few aspects that I believe are pertinent when it comes to CS training. This article is not exhaustive in itself. I have detailed only on the most important elements.

Usage of Technology</em></strong><em> - For all purposes of secretarial work, this is most important.&#160; Conducting of Board meetings - supply all the directors and invitees to Board meeting with Ipads etc with an app facility to look into the documents of notice, agenda and all annexures with proper hyperlinking.&#160; Just by press of that link, the directors can navigate to concerned document with an option to come back to the main document.</em>\n\n<strong><em>2. Presentation -</em></strong><em> Mere supply of bundle of documents is not a favourable thing now a days.&#160; The company secretary has to present the flow of events in the Board meeting or General meeting.&#160; Again usage of normal PPT will not make sense.&#160; It should be more informative and in presentable mode.</em>\n\n<strong><em>3. Follow Up -</em></strong><em> There is lot of requirement to follow up with various personnel. What kind of modes and methods to be adopted in this regard.&#160; Like sending auto sms on timely manner to directors or other stakeholders linking with calendar&#160;.</em>\n\n<strong><em>4. Record keeping -</em></strong><em> There is a huge amount of data to be stored.&#160; What modes can be adopted for effective and efficient record keeping?&#160;</em>\n\n<strong><em>5.
