<p><strong>Welcome to Company Secretary Club</strong></p>

<p>Company Secretary Club aka&nbsp;<strong>CSClub</strong>&nbsp;is a community created exclusively for Company Secretary students and members of the profession. As we all know CS is an emerging and much-in-demand course these days. With growing emphasis on corporate governance and integrity, Company Secretaries as professionals are carving a niche for themselves. Furthermore, a Company Secretary is not only restricted to companies or corporations. With each passing day, the profession is getting recognition across various realms- GST, Insolvency, NCLT, Local Governance etc. There is no better time to be a CS than now!</p>

<p><strong>CSClub</strong>&nbsp;aspires to create a robust community of upcoming and existing CS professionals, providing a platform for discussions, deliberations, information, and networking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ask questions related to Company Secretaryship- exams, results, subjects, work opportunities, everything you want to know about CS; create healthy discussions and deliberations on the course and the profession. We want&nbsp;<strong>CSClub</strong>&nbsp;to be your go-to place for all information relating to CS!</p>

<p><strong>We are going to shutdown CSClub Forum</strong></p>

<p>25th April</p>

<p>We are going to shut down our forum.&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.csclub.co/">https://forum.csclub.co</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://csclub.co/jobs/">Job board</a>&nbsp;is going to stay.</p>

<p>We thought the forum is good for discussions and it helps people learn from each other. The lack of engagement in the forum and also we do not have much budget for server costs, we decided to shut down and Job board will be there as you guys are giving good response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I request all of you if you think CSClub has helped you anyway and you want to show some gratitude,<br />
<strong>Please donate us</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instamojo.com/@vaibhavmule/">https://www.instamojo.com/@vaibhavmule/</a></p>

<p>Thanks</p>
